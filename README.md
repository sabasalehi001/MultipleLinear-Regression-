Overview
This repository contains code for a multiple linear regression exercise using a real estate dataset. The objective is to predict real estate prices based on property size and the year of acquisition. Real estate is a classic example frequently used in regression courses due to its simplicity and the often present causal relationships.

The dataset is stored in the file 'real_estate_price_size_year.csv'.

Instructions
Import Libraries:
Utilize necessary Python libraries for data analysis, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels.

Load Dataset:
Read the real estate dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The file name is 'real_estate_price_size_year.csv'.

Declare Variables:
Identify the dependent variable, 'price', and the independent variables, 'size' and 'year'.

Build Multiple Linear Regression Model:
Create a multiple linear regression model using the provided data.

Dataset Information
The dataset comprises real estate information with 'price' as the dependent variable and 'size' and 'year' as independent variables. The task involves exploring the relationship between these variables to predict real estate prices effectively.
